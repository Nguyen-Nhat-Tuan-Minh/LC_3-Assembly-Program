# LC-3 Assembly Language Program Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to the LC-3 Assembly Language Program Repository! This repository is a collection of LC-3 (Little Computer 3) assembly language programs developed by the author during their time at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology. The primary purpose of this repository is to share code, provide examples, and foster collaboration among students and enthusiasts interested in learning and exploring the LC-3 architecture.

## LC-3 Assembly Language

LC-3 is a simple assembly language designed for educational purposes. It is often used in computer architecture courses to teach fundamental concepts of computer organization and assembly programming. The LC-3 architecture consists of a small set of instructions, a limited number of registers, and straightforward memory access, making it an excellent platform for understanding the basics of computer architecture.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the source code in the `LC_3-Assembly-Program` directory and use it as a reference to understand LC-3 programming concepts. 

## Acknowledgments

The author would like to express gratitude to Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology for providing the foundational knowledge and resources that inspired the creation of this repository. Special thanks to the LC-3 community for fostering a collaborative learning environment.

Happy coding and exploring the fascinating world of LC-3 assembly language! ðŸš€
